  <h1 id = 'title' > How Bikable Is Your City Council District? </h1>

  <p id = 'text'> The state of bicycle infrastructure varies widely across New York City.
    This simple index is designed to help you understand how well your neighborhood - and your
    elected officials are doing - to help protect cyclists and promote low-carbon travel. </br> </br>
    The index takes into account only traditional and protected bikeways on city streets, comparing the
    mileage of these elements with the total road network in the Council District. Protected bikeways
    are weighted more heavily than traditional lanes in making this calculation.
    The City also installs shared streets or "sharrows" in  some areas, but these features
    don't provide substantial protection from motor vehicles. </br> </br>
    In the future, more information might be considered to improve this index and develop
    actionable planning tools for neighborhoods. Additional data may include high-crash intersections
    corridors, existing and planned street treatments such as daylighting at intersections, and
    traffic counts with an eye towards high truck traffic areas.
