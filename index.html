    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>The NYC Mayor's Office of Management & Budget (OMB) develops and releases
    the administration's adopted Five Year Capital Budget every year. The plan
    includes funding for capital projects across all City agencies for the next five
    fiscal years. Projects that improve the safety of City streets are undertaken by
    the Department of Transportation (DOT), but are sometimes also managed by the
    Department of Design & Construction (DDC) when work involves rebuilding water mains
     or sewers in addition to street construction.</p>
   </div>
   <div id='pjs'>
     <h2>Finding the Right Projects</h2>
     <p>The City funds thousands of projects in each five year budget, so finding the
       ones that make our streets safer is a challenge. Luckily, Chris Whong at qri
       has been able to scrape the <a class='link' href=https://www1.nyc.gov/site/omb/publications/fy21-accp.page>detailed PDFs</a> that include important scope and location
       data and create <a class='link' href=https://qri.cloud/chriswhong/nyc_capital_project_detail_data>usable tables</a>. Unfortunately, location
       data is often difficult to source for these projects because they are often tagged as "Citywide" or as affecting an
        entire borough when that is actually not true. To mitigate this, I used the Capital Budget knowledge I gained as
         Supervising Analyst in OMB's DOT Unit and Google to review individual scope information for projects that
         may impact street safety. After selecting DOT and DDC projects that appear to meet a broad definition of street improvement,
         I assigned the Community District (or Districts) that seemed most accurate if they were not already listed in the data.

      <h2>Included Project Types<h2>
      <h3>Bicycle & Pedestrian Improvements</h3>
      <p>These projects usually involve improving or building bike lanes, pedestrian plazas, and other related infrastructure.
        After completion, these projects make cycling and walking safer by providing protection and separation from traffic and
        employ other <a class='link' href=https://nacto.org/publication/urban-street-design-guide/intersection-design-elements/visibility-sight-distance/>techniques such as day-lighting at intersections to improve visibility</a>, allowing drivers to see pedestrians
        and cyclists before making a turn. Bicycle and pedestrian improvements are often linked within the same project scope, so
        it would be difficult to separate them.</p>
      <h3>Bus Network Improvements</h3>
      <p>These projects include bus lanes, queue jumps, and bus bulbs that speed up buses
