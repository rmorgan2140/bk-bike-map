# street-investments

This map includes data from the NYC Capital Budget adopted for FY21 covering five years of planned spending.

Projects were assigned Community Districts if they did not have one already tagged or were listed as borough or citywide when they did have
a discrete scope. Projects improving street safety were selected based on a manual review of scope as well.

Crash data was also analyzed for the past calendar year (2020) to show where streets are the most dangerous.

Ultimately, the question we are trying to answer is whether or not the city is investing in the areas most at risk of traffic injuries and deaths.
